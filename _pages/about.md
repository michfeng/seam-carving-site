This project focuses on parallel seam carving, a technique used for content-aware image resizing. We plan to use parallel computing techniques to optimize seam carving processes, aiming for faster and more efficient image resizing. We will be working with parallel computing systems like CUDA and GPUs to distribute computation tasks across multiple processing units, enhancing the speed and scalability of seam carving operations.
